# DSCI478KaggleProject
Kaggle Project for DSCI 478 @CSU

This repository encompasses our work on the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" Kaggle competition. Each of the individual models that we implemented are located in the "Models" folder and can be ran for reproducibility. We also have our EDA, Feature Engineering, and Cleaning notebooks within the "Cleaning_EDA_Eng" folder. All of our .pkl, csv submissions, and .joblib files can also be found within their respective folders.
